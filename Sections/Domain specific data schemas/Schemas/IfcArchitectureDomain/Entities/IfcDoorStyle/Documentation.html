<p>Definition: The door style, <em>IfcDoorStyle</em>, defines a particular style of doors, which may be included into the spatial context of the building model through instances of <em>IfcDoor</em>. A door style defines the overall parameter of the door style and refers to the particular parameter of the lining and one (or several) panels through the <em>IfcDoorLiningProperties</em> and the <em>IfcDoorPanelProperties</em>.</p>

<p>The door entity, <em>IfcDoor</em>, defines a particular occurrence of a door inserted in the spatial context of a
project. The actual parameter of the door and/or its shape is defined at the <em>IfcDoorStyle</em>, to which the <em>IfcDoor</em>
is related by the inverse relationship <em>IsDefinedBy</em> pointing to <em>IfcRelDefinedByType</em>. The <em>IfcDoorStyle</em>
also defines the particular attributes for the lining<em>, IfcDoorLiningProperties</em>, and panels, <em>IfcDoorPanelProperties</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>IfcDoorStyle</em> defines the baseline geometry, or the representation map, for all occurrences of the door style, given
by the <em>IfcDoor</em>, pointing to this style. The representation of the door style may be given by the agreed set of minimal
parameters, defined for the door lining and the door panel(s), or it may be given by a geometric representation used by the
<em>IfcRepresentationMap</em>. The attribute <em>ParameterTakesPrecedence</em> decides, whether the set of parameters can be used to exactly represent the shape of the door style (TRUE), or whether the attached <em>IfcRepresentationMap</em>
holds the exact representation (FALSE).</p>

<p>The <em>IfcDoorStyleOperationTypeEnum</em> defines the general layout of the door style. Depending on the enumerator, the
appropriate instances of <em>IfcDoorLiningProperties</em> and <em>IfcDoorPanelProperties</em> are attached in the list of
<em>HasPropertySets</em>. The <em>IfcDoorStyleOperationTypeEnum</em> mainly determines the hinge side (left hung, or right hung), the
operation (swinging, sliding, folding, etc.) and the number of panels.</p>

<p>See geometry use definitions at <em>IfcDoorStyleOperationTypeEnum</em> for the correct usage of opening symbols for different operation types.</p>
