<p>A transformer is an inductive stationary device that transfers electrical energy from one circuit to another.</p>
<p><em>IfcTransformer</em> is used to transform electric power; conversion of electric signals for other purposes is handled at other entities: <em>IfcController</em> converts arbitrary signals, <em>IfcAudioVisualAppliance</em> converts signals for audio or video streams, and <em>IfcCommunicationsAppliance</em> converts signals for data or other communications usage.</p>
