<p>This entity defines a reaction which occurs at a point.
A point reaction is typically connected with a point connection.
It may also be connected with a curve member or curve connection,
or surface member or surface connection.</p>

<p>Standard Case:<br>
If connected with a point item, instances of <em>IfcStructuralPointReaction</em>
shall not have an <em>ObjectPlacement</em> nor a <em>Representation</em>.
It is implied that the placement and representation of the reaction is the same
as the structural item.</p>

<p>Special Case 1:<br>
If connected with a curve item or surface item, instances of <em>IfcStructuralPointReaction</em>
shall have an <em>ObjectPlacement</em> and <em>Representation</em>, containing an <em>IfcVertexPoint</em>.
See <em>IfcStructuralActivity</em> for further definitions.</p>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; In order to model concentrated reactions on a curve or surface item,
<em>IfcStructuralCurveReaction</em> or <em>IfcStructuralSurfaceAction</em> of type DISCRETE is
preferable since they do not require an extra topology representation in this case.
An <em>IfcStructuralPointReaction</em> should be used for a concentrated reaction on a curve or surface
item only when an explicit vertex point representation is actually desired.</blockquote>

<p>Special Case 2:<br>
If not connected with a structural item (which may happen in an incomplete or
conceptual model), a point action should have an <em>ObjectPlacement</em> and
<em>Representation</em>, containing an <em>IfcVertexPoint</em>.
