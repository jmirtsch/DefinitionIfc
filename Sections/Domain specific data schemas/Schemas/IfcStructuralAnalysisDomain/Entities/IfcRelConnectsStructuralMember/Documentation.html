<p>The entity <em>IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember</em> defines all needed properties describing the connection between structural members and structural connection objects (nodes or supports).</p>

<blockquote class="history">HISTORY&nbsp; New entity in IFC2x2.</blockquote>

<p><b>Use Definition</b></p>

<p><em>Point Connection</em><br>
Instances of the entity <em>IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember</em> shall be used to describe a connection between an instance of <em>IfcStructuralPointConnection</em> and either an instance of <em>IfcStructuralCurveMember</em> or <em>IfcStructuralSurfaceMember</em>.  The <em>RelatedStructuralConnection</em> for point connections has to be of type <em>IfcStructuralPointConnection</em>.</p>

<p><em>Curve Connection</em><br>
Instances of the entity <em>IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember</em> shall be used to describe a connection between an instance of <em>IfcStructuralCurveConnection</em> and an instance of either <em>IfcStructuralCurveMember</em> or <em>IfcStructuralSurfaceMember</em>.  The <em>RelatedStructuralConnection</em> for curve connections has to be of type <em>IfcStructuralCurveConnection</em>.</p>

<p><em>Surface Connection</em><br>
Instances of the entity <em>IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember</em> shall be used to describe a connection between an instance of <em>IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection</em> and an instance of <em>IfcStructuralSurfaceMember</em>.  The <em>RelatedStructuralConnection</em> for curve connections has to be of type <em>IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection</em>.</p>

<p><em>Coordinate System for Applied Conditions</em><br>
All values defined by <em>AppliedCondition</em> or <em>AdditionalConditions</em> are given within the coordinate system provided by <em>ConditionCoordinateSystem</em>, which is defined relative to the local coordinate system of the structural member.  If the <em>ConditionCoordinateSystem</em> is not defined, the local coordinate system of the structural member is used instead.</p>

<p><em>Supported Length</em><br>
Optionally a supported length can be given, which specifies the length (or width) of the physical connection along a curve connection.</p>

<p>Figure 301 illustrates the appropriate definition of support lengths.</p>
