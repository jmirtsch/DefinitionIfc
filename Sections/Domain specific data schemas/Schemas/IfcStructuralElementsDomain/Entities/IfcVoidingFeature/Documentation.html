<p>A voiding feature is a modification of an element which reduces its volume.  Such a feature may be manufactured in different ways, for example by cutting, drilling, or milling of members made of various materials, or by inlays into the formwork of cast members made of materials such as concrete.</u></p>

<p>The standard use of instances of <em>IfcVoidingFeature</em> is as a part of element type objects (instances of subtypes of <em>IfcElementType</em>).  The part&ndash;whole relationship is established by an aggregation relationship object, expressing the decomposition of an element type into one or more additive elements (element parts) and zero or more feature elements.</p>
