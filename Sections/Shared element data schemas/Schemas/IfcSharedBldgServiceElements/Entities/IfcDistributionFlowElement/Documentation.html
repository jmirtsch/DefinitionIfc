IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Ports are now primarily defined using <em>IfcRelNests</em> to enable definition of ports at type definitions (both forward and backward compatible), provide a logical order, and reduce the number of relationship objects needed.  The relationship <em>IfcRelConnectsPortToElement</em> is still supported, however is now specific to dynamically connected ports.
