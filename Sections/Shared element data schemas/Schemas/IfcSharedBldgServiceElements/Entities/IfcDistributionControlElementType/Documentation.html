<p>The element type <em>IfcDistributionControlElementType</em> defines a list of commonly shared property set definitions of an element and an optional set of product representations.  It is used to define an element specification (the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type).</p> 
	 
<p>Distribution control element types (or the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.</p> 
	
<p>The occurrences of the <em>IfcDistributionControlElementType</em> are represented by instances of <em>IfcDistributionControlElement</em> or its subtypes.</p>

IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; Ports may now be defined using <em>IfcRelNests</em> to enable definition of ports at type definitions (both forward and backward compatible), provide a logical order, and reduce the number of relationship objects needed.  The relationship <em>IfcRelConnectsPortToElement</em> is still supported on occurrence objects, however is now specific to dynamically connected ports.
