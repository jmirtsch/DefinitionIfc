<p>
      <em>IfcBuildingElementProxyType</em> defines a list of
      commonly shared property set definitions of a building
      element proxy and an optional set of product
      representations. It is used to define an element
      specification (i.e. the specific product information, that
      is common to all occurrences of that product type).

      NOTE&nbsp; The product representations are defined as
        representation maps (at the level of the supertype
        <em>IfcTypeProduct</em>, which gets assigned by an element
        occurrence instance through the
        <em>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</em> being an
        <em>IfcMappedItem</em>.

    <p>
      A building element proxy type is used to define the common
      properties of a certain type of a building element proxy
      that may be applied to many instances of that type to
      assign a specific style. Building element proxy types may
      be exchanged without being already assigned to occurrences.
    </p>
<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; Although an building element proxy does not have a predefined ontological meaning the provision of a type may be helpful in sharing information among multiple occurrences. Applications that provide type information for element types not yet included in the current IFC specification can use the <em>IfcBuildingElementProxyType</em> to exchange such types.
