<p>The standard slab, <em>IfcSlabStandardCase</em>, defines a slab with certain constraints
for the provision of material usage, parameters and with certain constraints for the geometric representation. The
<em>IfcSlabStandardCase</em> handles all cases of slabs, that:</p>
<ul>
<li>have a reference to the <em>IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage</em> defining the material layers of the slab with thicknesses</li>
<li>are based on an extrusion of a planar surface as defined by the slab profile</li>
<li>have a constant thickness along the extrusion direction</li>
<li>are consistent in using the correct material layer set offset to the base planar surface in regard to the shape
representation</li>
<li>are extruded either perpendicular or slanted to the plane surface</li>
</ul>
<p>The definitions of slab openings and niches are the same as given at the supertype <em>IfcSlab</em>. The same agreements to the
special types of slabs, as defined in the <em>PredefinedType</em> attribute apply as well.</p>


<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; If the <em>IfcSlabStandardCase</em> is of type Landing
and is used within an <em>IfcStair</em> or <em>IfcRamp</em>, the
special agreements to handle stair and ramp geometry will also
affect the geometric representation of the
<em>IfcSlabStandardCase</em>.</blockquote>
