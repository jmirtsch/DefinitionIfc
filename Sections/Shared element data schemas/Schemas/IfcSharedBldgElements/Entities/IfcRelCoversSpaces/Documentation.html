<p>The objectified relationship, <em>IfcRelCoversSpace</em>,
relates a space object to one or many coverings, which faces (or is
assigned to) the space.</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; Particularly floorings,
ceilings and wall coverings, such as claddings or tiling are often
considered as space coverings, rather then wall or slab coverings.
In some life cycle phases, such as the operation phase, the
relationship is always made to the space.</blockquote>
<p>The IFC specification provides two relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>IfcRelCoversBldgElements</em> to assign coverings to
elements.
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; This relationship is now
deprecated and replaced by <em>IfcRelAggregates</em>.</blockquote>
</li>
<li><em>IfcRelCoversSpaces</em> to assign coverings to spaces<br>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; This relationship is now
deprecated and replaced by
<em>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</em>.</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether the relationship between the covering and the space, or
between the covering and the element, is regarded as primary, has
to be determined within the context of a model view definition.</p>
