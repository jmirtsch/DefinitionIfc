<p>The element type <em>IfcPlateType</em> defines commonly shared
information for occurrences of plates. The set of shared
information may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>common properties within shared property sets</li>
<li>common material information</li>
<li>common material layer definitions</li>
<li>common shape representations</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; It is illegal to share shape representations as representation maps for occurrences of <em>IfcPlateStandardCase</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>It is used to define a plate specification (i.e. the specific
product information, that is common to all occurrences of that
product type). Plate types may be exchanged without being already
assigned to occurrences.</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The product representations are defined as
representation maps (at the level of the supertype
<em>IfcTypeProduct</em>, which gets assigned by an element occurrence
instance through the <em>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</em> being an
<em>IfcMappedItem</em>.</blockquote>
<p>The occurrences of the <em>IfcPlateType</em> within building
models are represented by instances of <em>IfcPlateStandardCase</em>
if the <em>IfcPlateType</em> has a single associated
<em>IfcMaterialLayerSet</em>; otherwise they are represented by
instances of <em>IfcPlate</em>.</p>
