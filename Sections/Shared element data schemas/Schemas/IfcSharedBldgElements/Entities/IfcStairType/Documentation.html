<p>The building element type <em>IfcStairType</em> defines commonly shared information for occurrences of stairs. The set of shared information may include: <ul>
<li>common properties with shared property sets</li>
<li>common representations</li>
<li>common materials</li>

<p>It is used to define a stair type specification indicating the specific product information that is common to all occurrences of that product type. 
The <em>IfcStairType</em> may be declared within <em>IfcProject</em> or <em>IfcProjectLibrary</em> using <em>IfcRelDeclares</em> and may be exchanged with or without occurrences of the type. Occurrences of <em>IfcStairType</em> are represented by instances of <em>IfcStair</em>.
