<p>An <em>IfcMember</em> is a
structural member designed to carry loads between or beyond
points of support. It is not required to be load bearing. The
orientation of the member (being horizontal, vertical or sloped)
is not relevant to its definition (in contrary to <em>IfcBeam</em>
and <em>IfcColumn</em>). An <em>IfcMember</em> represents a linear
structural element from an architectural or structural modeling
point of view and shall be used if it cannot be expressed more
specifically as either an <em>IfcBeam</em> or an
<em>IfcColumn</em>.</p>

NOTE&nbsp; The representation of a member in a structural analysis model is provided by <em>IfcStructuralCurveMember</em> being part of an <em>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</em>.</blockquote>

<p>The IFC specification provides two entities for member
occurrences:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>IfcMemberStandardCase</em> used for all occurrences of
members, that have a profile defined that is swept along a
directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper
definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its
cardinal point of insertion qwort can be fully described by the
<em>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</em>. These beams are always
represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or
'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping'
geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric
representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a
corresponding <em>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</em> assigned.

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; View definitions and implementer agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types, such as by excluding tapering from an <em>IfcMemberStandardCase</em> implementation.
</blockquote>

</li>
<li><em>IfcMember</em> used for all other occurrences of members,
particularly for members with changing profile sizes along the
extrusion, or members defined by non-linear extrusion, or members
having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry.</li>
</ul>
