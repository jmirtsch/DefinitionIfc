<p>The <em>IfcRelCoversBldgElements</em> relationship is an
objectified relationship between an element and one to many
coverings, which cover that element.</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The definition of
<em>IfcCoverings</em> include both the coverings of building
elements, such as flooring or cladding. and the covering of
distribution elements, such as wrapping or sleeving.</blockquote>
<p>The IFC specification provides two relationships:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>IfcRelCoversBldgElements</em> to assign coverings to
elements.
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; This relationship is now
deprecated and replaced by <em>IfcRelAggregates</em>.</blockquote>
</li>
<li><em>IfcRelCoversSpaces</em> to assign coverings to spaces<br>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; This relationship is now
deprecated and replaced by
<em>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</em>.</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether the relationship between the covering and the space, or
between the covering and the element, is regarded as primary, has
to be determined within the context of a model view definition.</p>
