<p>An asset is a uniquely identifiable grouping of elements acting as a single entity that has a financial value or that can be operated on as a single unit.</p> 
 
<p>An asset is generally the level of granularity at which maintenance operations are undertaken. An asset is a group that can contain one or more elements. Whilst the financial value of a component or element can be defined, financial value is also defined for accounting purposes at the level of the asset.<br/>  <br/>There are a number of actors that can be associated with an asset, each actor having a role. Actors within the scope of the project are indicated using the <a href="../../ifckernel/lexical/ifcrelassignstoactor.htm">IfcRelAssignsToActor</a> relationship in which case roles should be defined through the <a href="../../ifcactorresource/lexical/ifcactorrole.htm">IfcActorRole</a> class; otherwise principal actors are identified as attributes of the class. In the existence of both, direct attributes take precedence.<br/>  <br/>There are a number of costs that can be associated with an asset, each cost having a role. These are specified through the <em>OriginalValue</em>, <em>CurrentValue</em>, <em>TotalReplacementCost</em> and <em>DepreciatedValue</em> attributes.</p>
