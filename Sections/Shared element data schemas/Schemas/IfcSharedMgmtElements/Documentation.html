<p>The <b>IfcSharedMgmtElements</b> schema defines basic concepts that are
		common to management throughout the various stages of the building lifecycle.
		The primary classes in the schema are all subtypes of <em>IfcControl</em> and act
		to manage or regulate the conduct of the project in some way. This schema,
		along with <em>IfcProcessExtension</em> and <em>IfcConstructionMgmtDomain</em>,
		provide a set of models that can be used by applications needing to share
		information concerning construction and facilities management related issues.</p> 

	 <p>The objective of the <b>IfcSharedMgmtElements</b> schema is to capture
		information that supports the control of project scope, cost, and time.
		The aim is to provide support for exchange and sharing of minimal information
		concerning the subjects in scope; the extent of the model will not support the
		more detailed ideas found in more specialized management applications.</p> 
	 <p>The following are within the scope of this part of the
		specifications:</p> 
	 <ul> 
		<li>Cost schedules supporting hierarchical rows and columns of costs and quantities.</li> 
		<li>Orders including purchase orders, change orders, and work orders.</li> 
                <li>Permits for access and carrying out work.</li>
                <li>Requests to be fulfilled.</li>
	 </ul> 
	 <p>The following are outside of the scope of this part of the specifications:</p> 
	 <ul> 
		<li>Transaction details that may be supported by or support electronic commerce.</li> 
	 </ul> 

<blockquote class="change-ifc2x4">
IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; The former schema <em>IfcFacilitiesMgmtDomain</em> has been merged into this schema to include the entities <em>IfcPermit</em> and <em>IfcActionRequest</em>, as each entity now also supports use in construction as well as facilities management.
