<p><em>IfcWorkTime</em> defines time periods that are used by <em>IfcWorkCalendar</em> for either describing working times or non-working exception times. Besides start and finish dates, a set of time periods can be given by various types of recurrence patterns.</p>

<p>A work time should have a meaningful name that describes the time periods (for example, working week, holiday name). Non-recurring time periods should have a start date (<em>IfcWorkTime.Start</em>) and a finish date (<em>IfcWorkTime.Finish</em>). In that case it is assumed that the time period begins at 0:00 on the start date and ends at 24:00 on the finish date.</p>

<p>The start and finish date is optional if a recurrence pattern is given (<em>IfcWorkTime.RecurrencePattern</em>).  They then restrict never-ending recurrence patterns.</p>
