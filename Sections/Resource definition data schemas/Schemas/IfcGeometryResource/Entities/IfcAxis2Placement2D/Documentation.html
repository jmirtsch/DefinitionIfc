<p>
      The <em>IfcAxis2Placement2D</em> provides location and
      orientation to place items in a two-dimensional space. The
      attribute <em>RefDirection</em> defines the x axis, the y
      axis is derived. If the attribute <em>RefDirection</em> is
      not given, the placement defaults to P[1] (x-axis) as [1.,0.]
      and P[2] (y-axis) as [0.,1.].

      NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
      The location and orientation in two dimensional space of two
      mutually perpendicular axes. An axis2_placement_2d is defined
      in terms of a point, (inherited from the placement
      supertype), and an axis. It can be used to locate and
      originate an object in two dimensional space and to define a
      placement coordinate system. The entity includes a point
      which forms the origin of the placement coordinate system. A
      direction vector is required to complete the definition of
      the placement coordinate system. The reference direction
      defines the placement X axis direction, the placement Y axis
      is derived from this.
