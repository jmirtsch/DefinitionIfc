<p>The <em>IfcRepresentationItem</em> is used within an <em>IfcRepresentation</em> (directly or indirectly through other <em>IfcRepresentationItem</em>'s) to represent an <em>IfcProductRepresentation</em>. Most commonly these <em>IfcRepresentationItem</em>'s are geometric or topological representation items, that can (but not need to) have presentation style infomation assigned.</p>

<blockquote class="extDef">
NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-43:1992<br>
A representation item is an element of product data that participates in one or more representations or
contributes to the definition of another representation item. A representation item contributes to the definition of another
representation item when it is referenced by that representation item.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The assignment of a style is only applicable
to the subtypes <em>IfcGeometricRepresentationItem</em>, <em>IfcMappedItem</em> and some selected subtypes of <em>IfcTopologicalRepresentationItem</em> (<em>IfcVertexPoint</em>, <em>IfcEdgeCurve</em>, <em>IfcFaceSurface</em>).
</blockquote>

<p>In case that presentation style information is applied, it can be either applied by an <em>IfcStyledItem</em>, or by an assignment to an <em>IfcPresentationLayerWithStyle</em>. If both are present, and both style assignments include the same subtype of <em>IfcPresentationStyle</em>, then the style assigned by <em>IfcStyledItem</em> takes priority.</p>

<p>Figure 360 shows an instance diagram explaining the use of <em>IfcStyledItem</em> and <em>IfcPresentationLayerWithStyle</em> to apply presentation styles.</p>
<blockquote class="example">
EXAMPLE&nbsp; The assignment of style information by a styled item and a presentation layer with style. Since the presentation styles are different, <em>IfcCurveStyle</em> and <em>IfcSurfaceStyle</em>, both are applied to the geometric representation item.

<blockquote class="example">
EXAMPLE&nbsp; The assignment of style information by a styled item and a presentation layer with style. Since the presentation styles for curve style are aprovided by both, the <em>IfcCurveStyle</em> provided by the <em>IfcStyledItem</em> overrides the <em>IfcCurveStyle</em> provided by the <em>IfcPresentationLayerWithStyle</em>
