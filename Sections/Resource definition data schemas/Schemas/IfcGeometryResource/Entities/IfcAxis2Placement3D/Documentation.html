<p>
      The <em>IfcAxis2Placement3D</em> provides location and orientations to
      place items in a three-dimensional space. The attribute
      <em>Axis</em> defines the Z direction, <em>RefDirection</em>
      the X direction. The Y direction is derived.

      NOTE&nbsp; The <em>RefDirection</em> does not have to be
      orthogonal to <em>Axis</em>.

    <p>
      If the attribute values for <em>Axis</em> and
      <em>RefDirection</em> are not given, the placement defaults to
      P[1] (x-axis) as [1.,0.,0.], P[2] (y-axis) as [0.,1.,0.] and
      P[3] (z-axis) as [0.,0.,1.].

      NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
      The location and orientation in three dimensional space of
      three mutually perpendicular axes. An axis2_placement_3D is
      defined in terms of a point (inherited from placement
      supertype) and two (ideally orthogonal) axes. It can be used
      to locate and orientate a non axi-symmetric object in space
      and to define a placement coordinate system. The entity
      includes a point which forms the origin of the placement
      coordinate system. Two direction vectors are required to
      complete the definition of the placement coordinate system.
      The axis is the placement Z axis direction and the
      ref_direction is an approximation to the placement X axis
      direction.
