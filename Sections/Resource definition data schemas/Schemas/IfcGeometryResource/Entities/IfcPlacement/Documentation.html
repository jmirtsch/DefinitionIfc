<p>An <em>IfcPlacement</em> is an abstract supertype of placement
      subtypes that define the location of an item, or an entire
      shape representation, and provide its orientation. All
      placement subtypes define right-handed Cartesian coordinate
      systems and do not allow mirroring.

      A placement locates a geometric item with respect to the
      coordinate system of its geometric context. It locates the
      item to be defined and, in the case of the axis placement
      subtypes, gives its orientation.
