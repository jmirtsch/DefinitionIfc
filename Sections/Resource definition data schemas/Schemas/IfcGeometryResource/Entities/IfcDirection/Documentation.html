<p>
      The <em>IfcDirection</em> provides a direction in two or
      three dimensional space depending on the number of
      <em>DirectionRatio</em>'s provided. The <em>IfcDirection</em>
      does not imply a vector length, and the direction ratios does
      not have to be normalized.

      This entity defines a general direction vector in two or
      three dimensional space. The actual magnitudes of the
      components have no effect upon the direction being defined,
      only the ratios X:Y:Z or X:Y are significant.
