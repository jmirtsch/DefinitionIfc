<p>An <em>IfcSeamCurve</em> is a 3-dimensional curve that has additional representations provided by exactly two distinct pcurves describing the same curve at the two extreme ends of a closed parametric surface.</p>

NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
A seam curve is a type of surface curve, that is a curve on a closed parametric surface which has two distinct representations as constant parameter curves at the two extremes of the parameter range for the surface.
