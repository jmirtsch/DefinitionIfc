<p>The <em>IfcMaterialProfileSet</em> is a designation by which individual material(s) of a prismatic element (for example, beam or column) constructed of a single or multiple material profiles is known.</p>

<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; In case of multiple <em>MaterialProfiles</em>, the relative positioning of individual profiles in <em>IfcMaterialProfileSet</em> are defined using the concept of <em>IfcCompositeProfileDef</em> in <em>IfcProfileResource</em> schema; otherwise, only one <em>MaterialProfile</em> is given and defined by an individual <em>IfcProfileDef</em> (subtype).</blockquote>
