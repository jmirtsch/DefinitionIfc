<p>The <em>IfcCostResource</em> schema provides the means to identify cost values.</p> 

<p>A cost value specifies an amount or a value that has an effect on the amount that is applied to an object in the units of measure applicable to the value type. A cost value may have an applicable date that can be used to provide a basis on which fluctuations in price can be established or that otherwise identifies when the cost value was applied.</p> 

<p>Each cost value may have a unit basis which determines how a total value should be determined for objects. This is relevant where values are identified per unit quantity of an item.</p> 

<p>An individual cost value may be defined according to the values of a set of component values and may also be identified as a component of other values. This is achieved through the assertion of an applied value relationship which acts as a container for applied value components.</p>
