<p>
      The <em>IfcTextureVertexList</em> defines an ordered
      collection of texture vertices. Each texture vertex is
      a two-dimensional vertex provided by a fixed list of
      two  texture coordinates. The attribute <em>TexCoordsList</em> is a
      two-dimensional list, where
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>first dimension is an unbounded list representing each
      texture vertex;
      </li>
      <li>second dimension is a fixed list of two list members,
      where [1] is the S-coordinate, and [2] the T-coordinate of 
			the texture vertex.
      </li>
    </ul>

      NOTE&nbsp; The <em>IfcTextureVertexList</em> is introduced
      to provide a compact representation of an indexable
      representation of texture coordinates for texture maps
