<p>The <em>IfcFillAreaStyleTiles</em> defines the filling of an
<em>IfcAnnotationFillArea</em> by recurring patterns of styled two dimensional
geometry, called a tile. The recurrence pattern is determined by two vectors,
that multiply the tile in regular form.</p>
<p>The two vectors act as a two dimensional repeat factor that determins eight
new positions for the tiles.</p>
<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 10303-46:<br>
The fill area style tiles defines a two dimensional tile to be used for the
filling of annotation fill areas or other closed regions. The content of a tile
is defined by the tile set, and the placement of each tile determined by the
filling pattern which indicates how to place tiles next to each other. Tiles or
parts of tiles outside of the annotation fill area or closed region shall be
clipped at the of the area or region.</blockquote>
