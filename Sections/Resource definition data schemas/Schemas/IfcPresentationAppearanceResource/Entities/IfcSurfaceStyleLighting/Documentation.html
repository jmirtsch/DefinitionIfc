<p><em>IfcSurfaceStyleLighting</em> is a container class for properties for calculation of physically exact illuminance related to a particular surface style.</p>

<p>Figure 380 shows the reflection and transmission components from an incident ray. The sum of the components for reflection and transmission is a value of 1.0 denoting that the incident ray is completely decomposed into reflection and transmission components. Each value of reflection and transmission is therefore within the range 0.0 to 1.0.</p>

<p>All these factors can be measured physically and are ratios for the red, green and blue part of the light. These properties are defined in the model as Type <em>IfcColorRGB</em> with a factor for each colour.</p> 

<blockquote class="example"> 
EXAMPLE&nbsp; A green glass transmits only green light, so its transmission factor is 0.0 for red, between 0.0 and 1.0 for green and 0.0 for blue. A green surface reflects only green light, so the reflectance factor is 0.0 for red, between 0.0 and 1.0 for green and 0.0 for blue.
