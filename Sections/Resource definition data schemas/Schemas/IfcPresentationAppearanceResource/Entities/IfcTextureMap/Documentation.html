<p>
      An <em>IfcTextureMap</em> provides the mapping of the
      2-dimensional texture coordinates to the surface onto which
      it is mapped. It is used for mapping the texture to surfaces
      of vertex based geometry models, such as
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>IfcFacetedBrep</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>IfcFacetedBrepWithVoids</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>IfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>IfcShellBasedSurfaceModel</em>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <em>IfcTextureMap</em> has a list of
      <em>TextureVertex</em>, that corresponds to the points of the
      outer face bound of the vertex based geometry item. The
      corresponding pair of lists is:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>the list of <em>Polygon</em> of the
      <em>IfcFaceOuterBound</em> of type
      <em>IfcCartesianPoint</em>, and
      </li>
      <li>the list of <em>Vertices</em> of type
      <em>IfcTextureVertex</em>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Each <em>IfcTextureVertex</em> (given as S, T coordinates of
      the 2-dimension texture coordinate system) corresponds to the
      geometric coordinates of the <em>IfcCartesianPoint</em>
      (given as 3-dimension X, Y, and Z coordinates within the
      object coordinate system of the geometric item).

        The TextureCoordinate node is a geometry property node that
        specifies a set of 2D texture coordinates used by
        vertex-based geometry nodes to map textures to
        vertices.

        NOTE&nbsp; In contrary to
        the X3D vertext based geometry, for example IndexedFaceSet
        and ElevationGrid, the vertext based geometry in IFC may
        include inner loops. The areas of inner loops have to be
        cut-out from the texture applied to the outer loop.
