<p>The <em>IfcColourRgbList</em> defines an ordered collection of RGB colour values. Each colour value is a fixed list of three colour components (red, green, blue). The attribute <em>ColourList</em> is a two-dimensional list, where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>first dimension is an unbounded list representing each colour value;</li>
  <li>second dimension is a fixed list of four list members, where [1] is the red component, [2] the green component, and [3] the blue component.</li>
</ul>
