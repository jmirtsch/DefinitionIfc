<p>The <em>IfcFaceBasedSurfaceModel</em> represents the a shape by connected face sets. The connected faces have a dimensionality 2 and are placed in a coordinate space of dimensionality 3.</p>
<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
A face based surface model is described by a set of connected face sets of dimensionality 2. The connected face sets
shall not intersect except at edges and vertices, except that a face in one connected face set may overlap a face in
another connected face set, provided the face boundaries are identical. There shall be at least one connected face
set.<br>
A connected face set may exist independently of a surface model.</blockquote>
