<p>The <em>IfcRightCircularCone</em> is a Construction Solid
Geometry (CSG) 3D primitive. It is a solid with a circular base and
a point called apex as the top. The tapers from the base to the
top. The axis from the center of the circular base to the apex is
perpendicular to the base. The inherited <em>Position</em>
attribute defines the <em>IfcAxisPlacement3D</em> and provides the
location and orientation of the cone:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position</em>: The location and
orientation of the axis system for the primitive.&nbsp;</li>
<li><em>SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.Location</em>: The center
of the circular area being the bottom face of the cone.</li>
<li><em>SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.Position[3]:</em> The
z-axis of the inherited placement coordinate system provides the
center axis of the <em>IfcRightCircularCone</em>, and the apex is
at the <em>Height</em> value applied to the positive direction of
the z-axis. The <em>BottomRadius</em> defines the circular base at
the xy-plane of the placement coordinate system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 333 illustrates geometric parameters of the cone. The cone is positioned within its own placement coordinate system. The origin is the center of the bottom circular disk, that lies in the XY plane. The apex lies on the positive z axis at [0, 0, <em>Height</em>].</p>

<p class="use-head">Texture use definition</p>
<p>On the circular side, textures are aligned facing upright with
origin at the back (+Y direction) revolving counter-clockwise.
Textures are stretched or repeated to the extent of the base
circumference according to RepeatS. Textures are compressed
linearly going upwards towards the top point according to
RepeatT.</p>
<p>On the bottom face, textures are aligned facing front-to-back,
with the center of the circle aligned to the center of the
texture.</p>

<p>Figure 334 illustrates default texture mapping with a clamped texture (RepeatS=False and RepeatT=False). The image on the left shows the texture where the S axis points to the right and the T axis points up. The image on the right shows the texture applied to the geometry where the X axis points back to the right, the Y axis points back to the left, and the Z axis points up.</p>
