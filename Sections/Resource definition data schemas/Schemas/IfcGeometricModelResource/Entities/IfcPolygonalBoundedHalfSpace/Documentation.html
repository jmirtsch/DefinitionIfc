<p>The polygonal bounded half space is a special subtype of a half space solid, where the material of the half space
used in Boolean expressions is bounded by a polygonal boundary. The base surface of the half space is positioned by its
normal relative to the object coordinate system (as defined at the supertype <em>IfcHalfSpaceSolid</em>),&nbsp;and its
polygonal (with or without arc segments) boundary is defined in the XY plane of the position coordinate system
established by the <em>Position</em> attribute, the subtraction body is extruded perpendicular to the XY plane of the
position coordinate system, that is, into the direction of the positive Z axis defined by the <em>Position</em>
attribute.</p>
<p>The boundary is defined by a 2 dimensional polyline (or 2 dimensional composite curve, consisting of straight
segments and circular arc segments) within the XY plane of the position coordinate system. The side of the surface
which is in the half space is determined by the surface normal and the agreement flag. If the agreement flag is TRUE,
then the subset is the one the normal points away from. If the agreement flag is FALSE, then the subset is the one the
normal points into.</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; A polygonal bounded half space is not a subtype of <em>IfcSolidModel</em>, half
space solids are only useful as operands in Boolean expressions.</blockquote>

<p>
The polygonal bounded half space is used to limit the volume of the half space in Boolean difference expressions. Only
the part that is defined by a theoretical intersection between the half space solid and an extruded area solid, defined
by extruding the polygonal boundary, is used for Boolean expressions.</p>
<p>
The <em>PolygonalBoundary</em> defines the 2D polyline which bounds the effectiveness of the half space in Boolean
expressions. The <em>BaseSurface</em> is defined by a plane, and the normal of the plane together with the
<em>AgreementFlag</em> defines the side of the material of the half space.</p>
