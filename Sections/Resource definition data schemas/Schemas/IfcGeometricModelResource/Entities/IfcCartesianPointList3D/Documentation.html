<p>The <em>IfcCartesianPointList3D</em> defines an ordered collection of three-dimentional Cartesian points. Each Cartesian point is provided as an three-dimensional point by a fixed list of three coordinates. The attribute <em>CoordList</em> is a two-dimensional list, where</p>
<ul>
 <li>first dimension is an unbounded list representing each 3D Cartesian point;</li>
 <li>second dimension is a fixed list of three list members, where [1] is the x-coordinate, [2] the y-coordinate and [3] the z-coordinate of the Cartesian point.</li>
</ul>

NOTE&nbsp; The <em>IfcCartesianPointList</em> is introduced to provide a compact representation of larger list of points, such as in point clouds, and in indexable representation of points used as vertices in tessellated items or poly curves.</blockquote>
