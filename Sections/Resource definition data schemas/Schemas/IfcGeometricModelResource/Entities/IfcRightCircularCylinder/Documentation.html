<p>The <em>IfcRightCircularCylinder</em> is a Construction Solid Geometry (CSG) 3D primitive. It is a solid with a
circular base and top. The cylindrical surface between if formed by points at a fixed distance from the axis of the
cylinder. The inherited <em>Position</em> attribute defines the <em>IfcAxisPlacement3D</em> and provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position</em>: The location and orientation of the axis system for the primitive.</li>
<li><em>SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.Location</em>: The center of the circular area being the bottom face of the
cylinder.</li>
<li><em>SELF\IfcCsgPrimitive3D.Position.Position[3]:</em> The z axis provides the center axis and the height is
measured from the origin along the positive direction of the z axis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 335 illustrates geometric parameters of the cylinder. The cylinder is positioned within its own placement
coordiante system. The origin is the center of the bottom circular disk, that lies in the XY plane. The center of the
top circular disk is on the positive z axis at [0, 0, <em>Height</em>].</p>

<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
A right circular cylinder is a CSG primitive in the form of a solid cylinder of finite height. It is defined by an axis
point at the centre of one planar circular face, an axis, a height, and a radius. The faces are perpendicular to the
axis and are circular discs with the specified radius. The height is the distance from the first circular face centre
in the positive direction of the axis to the second circular face centre.</blockquote>

<p class="use-head">Texture use definition</p>
<p>On the circular side, textures are aligned facing upright with origin at the back (+Y direction) revolving
counter-clockwise. Textures are stretched or repeated to the extent of the circumference according to RepeatS. Textures
are stretched or repeated to the extent of the <em>Height</em> according to RepeatT.</p>
<p>On the top and bottom faces, textures are aligned facing front-to-back, with the center of the circle aligned to the
center of the texture.</p>
<p>Figure 336 illustrates default texture mapping with a clamped texture (RepeatS=False and RepeatT=False). The image
on the left shows the texture where the S axis points to the right and the T axis points up. The image on the right
shows the texture applied to the geometry where the X axis points back to the right, the Y axis points back to the
left, and the Z axis points up.</p>
