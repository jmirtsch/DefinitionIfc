<p>The <em>IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid</em> is the result of sweeping an area along a directrix that lies on a
reference surface. The swept area is provided by a subtype of <em>IfcProfileDef</em>. The profile is placed
by an implicit cartesian transformation operator at the start point of the sweep, where the profile normal agrees
to the tangent of the directrix at this point, and the profile's x-axis agrees to the surface normal. At any point
along the directrix, the swept profile origin lies on the directrix, the profile's normal points towards the tangent
of the directrix, and the profile's x-axis is identical to the surface normal at this point.</p> 
<blockquote class="note">
NOTE&nbsp; The profile area's normal has to be identical to the tangent of the directrix at any given point. In case
of a directrix having a linear segment at the start point, the segment has to be perpendicular to the profile at start.

<p>The <em>Directrix</em> and the <em>ReferenceSurface</em> are positioned within the object coordinate system. The start of the sweeping operation is at the <em>StartParam</em>, the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization. If no <em>StartParam</em> is provided the start defaults to the begin of the directrix. The end of the sweeping operation is at the <em>EndParam</em>, the parameter value is provided based on the curve parameterization. If no <em>EndParam</em> is provided the end defaults to the end of the directrix. The geometric shape of the solid is not dependent upon the curve parameterization; the volume depends upon the area swept and the length of the <em>Directrix</em>.</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The <em>StartParam</em> and the <em>EndParam</em> are not normalized by default, they depend upon the parameterization of the curve. However using the <em>IfcReparametrisedCompositeCurveSegment</em> within an <em>IfcCompositeCurve</em> as the directrix allows to explicitly reparameterize the underlying sweeping curve. In case of a closed curve, such as <em>IfcCircle</em> or <em>IfcEllipse</em>, as the directrix, <em>StartParam</em> and the <em>EndParam</em> shall not exceed the parametic range, they shall not be &gt; 360&deg;.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="example">
EXAMPLE&nbsp; The reference surface is any surface (plane, cylindric, composite) situated in 3D space and positioned in the object coordinate system. In most cases, it is a plane or a surface of extrusion. The directrix lies on the surface, in case of a plane it might be defined as a polyline or composite curve, in case of a cylindrical or other non-planer reference surface it might often be defined as a p-curve on this reference surface. </blockquote>
<p>At any point of the directrix, a plane can be constructed. The origin of the position coordinate system of the implicit plane lies at the directrix. The Axis3 (the z-axis, or normal) of the position coordinate system is identical to the tangent of the directrix at this point, the Axis1 (the x axis, or u) of the position coordinate system is identical to the normal of the reference surface at this point. The Axis2 (the y axis, or v) is constructed.</p>

<p>The resulting body of the swept solid is not repositioned if the inherited <em>Position</em> attribute is omitted. Otherwise the coordinate system established by the <em>Position</em> attribute is used to reposition the body relative to the object coordinate system.</p>

<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO/CD 10303-42:1992<br>
A surface curve swept area solid is a type of swept area solid which is the result of sweeping a face along a <em>Directrix</em> lying on a <em>ReferenceSurface</em>. The orientation of the <em>SweptArea</em> is related to the direction of the surface normal.<br>
<br>
The <em>SweptArea</em> is required to be a curve bounded surface lying in the plane z = 0 and this is swept along the <em>Directrix</em> in such a way that the origin of the local coordinate system used to define the <em>SweptArea</em> is on the <em>Directrix</em> and the local x-axis is in the direction of the normal to the <em>ReferenceSurface</em> at the current point. The resulting solid has the property that the cross section of the surface by the normal plane to the <em>Directrix</em> at any point is a copy of the <em>SweptArea</em>.<br>
<br>
The orientation of the <em>SweptArea</em> as it sweeps along the <em>Directrix</em> is precisely defined by a Cartesian Transformation Operator 3D with attributes:
<ul>
<li class="extDef">Local origin as point (0., 0., 0),</li>
<li class="extDef">Axis 1 as the normal N to the reference surface at the point of the directrix with parameter u.</li>
<li class="extDef">Axis 3 as the direction of the tangent vector t at the point of the directrix with parameter u.<br>
The remaining attributes are defaulted to define a corresponding transformation matrix T(u), which varies with the directrix parameter u.</li>
</ul>
