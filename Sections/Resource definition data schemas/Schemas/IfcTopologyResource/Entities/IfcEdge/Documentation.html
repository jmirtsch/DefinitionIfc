An edge is the topological construct corresponding to the connection of two
vertices. More abstractly, it may stand for a logical relationship between two vertices. The domain of an edge, if
present, is a finite, non-self-intersecting open curve in <em>R<sup>M</sup></em>, that is, a connected 1-dimensional
manifold. The bounds of an edge are two vertices, which need not be distinct. The edge is oriented by choosing its traversal
direction to run from the first to the second vertex. If the two vertices are the same, the edge is a self loop. The domain of the
edge does not include its bounds, and 0 &le; &Xi; &le; &infin;. Associated with an edge may be a geometric curve to locate the
edge in a coordinate space; this is represented by the edge curve subtype. The curve shall be finite and non-self-intersecting within 
the domain of the edge. An edge is a graph, so its multiplicity M and graph genus <em>G<sup>e</sup></em> may be determined by the 
graph traversal algorithm. Since <em>M</em> = <em>E</em> = 1, the Euler equation (1) reduces in the case to:

where <em>V</em> = 1 or 2, and <em>G<sup>e</sup></em> = 1 or 0. Specifically, the topological edge defining data shall satisfy:
