<p>
      An <em>IfcMetric</em> is used to capture quantitative
      resultant metrics that can be applied to objectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>IfcMetric</em> is a subtype of <em>IfcConstraint</em> and
      may be associated with any subtype of <em>IfcRoot</em>
      through the <em>IfcRelAssociatesConstraint</em> relationship
      in the <em>IfcControlExtension</em> schema, or may be
      associated with <em>IfcProperty</em> by
      <em>IfcResourceConstraintRelationship</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aim of <em>IfcMetric</em> is to capture the quantitative
      aspects of a constraint.
