<p>An <em>IfcObjective</em> captures qualitative information for an objective-based constraint.</p>

<p><em>IfcObjective</em> is a subtype of <em>IfcConstraint</em> and may be associated with any subtype of <em>IfcRoot</em> through the <em>IfcRelAssociatesConstraint</em> relationship in the <em>IfcControlExtension</em> schema, or may be associated with <em>IfcProperty</em> by <em>IfcResourceConstraintRelationship</em>.</p>

<p>The aim of <em>IfcObjective</em> is to specify the purpose for which the constraint is applied and to capture the benchmark metrics of the constraint.</p>
