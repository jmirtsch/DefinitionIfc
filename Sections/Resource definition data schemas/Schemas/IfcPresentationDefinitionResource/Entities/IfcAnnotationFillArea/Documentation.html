<p>The <em>IfcAnnotationFillArea</em> defines an area by a definite
<em>OuterBoundary</em>, that might include <em>InnerBoundaries</em>. The areas
defined by the <em>InnerBoundaries</em> are excluded from applying the fill
area style. The <em>InnerBoundaries</em> shall not intersect with the
<em>OuterBoundary</em> nor being outside of the <em>OuterBoundary</em>.</p>
<p>The fill area style that is applied to the <em>IfcAnnotationFillArea</em> is
declared using the <em>IfcFillAreaStyle</em>, associated to the area by an
<em>IfcStyledItem</em>. Applicable fill area styles are a solid color, a
hatching, tiles, or a combination of those styles.</p>
<blockquote class="extDef">NOTE&nbsp; Definition according to ISO 10303-46:<br>
An annotation fill area is a set of curves that may be filled with hatching,
colour or tiling. The annotation fill are is described by boundaries which
consist of non-intersecting, non-self-intersecting closed curves. These curves
form the boundary of planar areas to be filled according to the style for the
annotation fill area.</blockquote>
