<p>The text literal with extent is a text literal with the additional explicit
information of the planar extent. An alignment attribute defines how the text
box is aligned to the placement and how it may expand if additional lines of
text need to be added.</p>
<p>Figure 386 shows the use of planar extent and box alignment to position the
text string</p>

<p>The planar extent defines the box model within which the text is placed.
Padding maybe defined in the text style that offsets the text from the box to
its inside.</p>
