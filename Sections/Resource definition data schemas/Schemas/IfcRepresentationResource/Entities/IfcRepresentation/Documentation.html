      The <em>IfcRepresentation</em> defines the general concept of
      representing product properties and in particular the product
      shape.

      NOTE&nbsp; Definition from ISO 10303-43:<br>
      A representation is a collection of one or more representation items that are
      related in a specified representation context. The relationship of representation
			item to representation context is the basis for distinguishing which representation
			item entities are related.<br><br>
			A representation item can be related to a representation context directly, when it 
			occurs as an element is a representation, or indirectly, when it is referenced
			through any number of intervening entities, each of type representation item.
