<p>The space boundary defines the physical or virtual delimiter of a space by the relationship <em>IfcRelSpaceBoundary</em> to the surrounding elements.</p>
<ul>
 <li>In the case of a physical space boundary, the placement and shape of the boundary may be given, and the building element, providing the boundary, is referenced,</li>
 <li>In the case of a virtual space boundary, the placement and shape of the boundary may be given, and a virtual element is referenced.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>IfcRelSpaceBoundary</em> is defined as an objectified relationship that handles the element to space relationship by objectifying the relationship between an element and the space it bounds. It is given as a one-to-one relationship, but allows each element (including virutal elements and openings) to define many such relationship and each space to be defined by many such relationships.</p>

<p>Space boundaries are always defined as seen from the space. In general two basic types of space boundaries are distinguished:</p>
<ul>
 <li>1<sup><small>st</small></sup> level space boundary: defined as boundaries of the space, not taking into account any change in building element or spaces on the other side.</li>
 <li>2<sup><small>nd</small></sup> level space boundary: defined as boundary taking any change in building element or spaces on the other side into account. It can be further distinguished into 
 <ul>
  <li>2<sup><small>nd</small></sup> level type A: There is a space on the other side.</li>
  <li>2<sup><small>nd</small></sup> level type B: There is a building element on the other side.</li>
 </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><small>The exact definition of how space boundaries are broken down depends on the view definition, more detailed conventions on how space boundaries are decomposed can only be given at the domain or application type level.</small>
<ul>
 <li><small>In an architectural or FM related view, a space boundary is defined totally from inside the space. This is a 1<sup><small>st</small></sup> level space boundary.</small></li>
 <li><small>In a thermal view, the decomposition of the space boundary depends on the material of the providing building element and the adjacent spaces behind. This is a 2<sup><small>nd</small></sup> level space boundary.</small></li>
</ul>

<p>The differences between the 1<sup><small>st</small></sup> and 2<sup><small>nd</small></sup> level space boundaries is identified by:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>1<sup><small>st</small></sup> level:</b><br> SELF\IfcRoot.Name = "1stLevel"<br> SELF\IfcRootDescription = NIL</li>
<li><b>2<sup><small>nd</small></sup> level:</b><br> SELF\IfcRoot.Name = "2ndLevel"<br> SELF\IfcRootDescription = "2a", or "2b"</li>
</ul>
<p>Differentiation between physical and virtual space boundary is illustrated in Figure 168 and Figure 42.</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 41, if the <em>IfcRelSpaceBoundary</em> is used to express a virtual boundary, the attribute <em>PhysicalOrVirtualBoundary</em> has to be set to VIRTUAL. The attribute <em>RelatedBuildingElement</em> shall point to an instance of <em>IfcVirtualElement</em>. If the correct location is of interest, the attribute <em>ConnectionGeometry</em> is required.</p>
<blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The connection geometry, either by a 2D curve or a 3D surface, is used to describe the portion of the "virtual wall" that separates the two spaces. All instances of <em>IfcRelSpaceBoundary</em> given at the adjacent spaces share the same instance of <em>IfcVirtualElement</em>. Each instance of <em>IfcRelSpaceBoundary</em> provides in addition the <em>ConnectionGeometry</em> given within the local placement of each space.</blockquote>

<p>As shown in Figure 42, if the <em>IfcRelSpaceBoundary</em> is used to express a physical boundary between two spaces, the attribute <em>PhysicalOrVirtualBoundary</em> has to be set to PHYSICAL.

The attribute <em>ConnectionGeometry</em> may be inserted, in this case it describes the physical space boundary geometically, or it may be omited, in that case it describes a physical space boundary logically.</p>
