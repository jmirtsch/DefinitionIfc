      The
      <em>IfcDistributionElementType</em> defines a list of commonly
      shared property set definitions of an element and an optional
      set of product representations. It is used to define an
      element specification (i.e. the specific product information,
      that is common to all occurrences of that product type).
    </p>
    <blockquote class="note">NOTE&nbsp; The product representations are defined as
      representation maps (at the level of the supertype
      <em>IfcTypeProduct</em>, which gets assigned by an element
      occurrence instance through the
      <em>IfcShapeRepresentation.Item[1]</em> being an
      <em>IfcMappedItem</em>.</blockquote>
    <p>
      A distribution element type is used to define the common
      properties of a certain type of a distribution element that
      may be applied to many instances of that feature type to
      assign a specific style. Distribution element types (or the
      instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without being already
      assigned to occurrences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occurrences of the <em>IfcDistributionElementType</em> are
      represented by instances of <em>IfcDistributionElement</em> (or
      its subtypes).
