      A system is an organized combination of
      related parts within an AEC product, composed for a common
      purpose or function or to provide a service. A system is
      essentially a functionally related aggregation of products.
      The grouping relationship to one or several instances of
      <em>IfcProduct</em> (the system members) is handled by
      <em>IfcRelAssignsToGroup</em>.

      NOTE&nbsp; The use of <em>IfcSystem</em> often
      applies to the representation of building services related
      systems, such as the piping system, cold water system, etc.
      Members within such a system may or may not be connected
      using the connectivity related entities (through <em>IfcDistributionPort</em>).
