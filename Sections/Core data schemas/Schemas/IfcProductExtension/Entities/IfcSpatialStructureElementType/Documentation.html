<p>
      The element type
      (<em>IfcSpatialStructureElementType</em>) defines a list of
      commonly shared property set definitions of a spatial
      structure element and an optional set of product
      representations. It is used to define an element
      specification (i.e. the specific element information, that
      is common to all occurrences of that element type).

      <p>NOTE&nbsp; The product representations are defined as

        occurrence instance through the

      A spatial structure element type is used to define the
      common properties of a certain type of a spatial structure
      element that may be applied to many instances of that type
      to assign a specific style. Spatial structure element types
      (the instantiable subtypes) may be exchanged without
      being already assigned to occurrences.
