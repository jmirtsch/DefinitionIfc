      The nesting relationship <em>IfcRelNests</em> is a special type
      of the general composition/decomposition (or whole/part)
      relationship <em>IfcRelDecomposes</em>. The nesting
      relationship can be applied to all non physical subtypes of
      object and object types, namely processes, controls (like
      cost items), and resources. It can also be applied to
      physical subtypes of object and object types, namely elements
      having ports. The nesting implies an order among the nested
      parts.

      EXAMPLE&nbsp; A nesting of costs items in an
      <em>IfcCostSchedule</em> is the composition of complex cost
      items from other cost items. The order of the nested cost
      items underneath the parent cost item is determined by the
      order of the list of <em>RelatedObjects</em>.

      EXAMPLE&nbsp; A nesting of <em>IfcTask</em>'s within a work
      schedule is the composition of a parent work task from more
      specific sub work tasks. The order of the sub tasks
      underneath the parent task is determined by the order of the
      list of <em>RelatedObjects</em>.

      be nested within an <em>IfcDistributionElement</em>. They
      decompose the distribution element and have an implied order.

    <p>
      Decompositions imply a dependency, i.e. the definition of the
      whole depends on the definition of the parts and the parts
      depend on the existence of the whole. The behaviour that is
      implied from the dependency has to be established inside the
      applications.

      IFC4 CHANGE&nbsp; The attributes <em>RelatingObject</em> and
      <em>RelatedObjects</em> are demoted from the supertype
      <em>IfcRelDecomposes</em>, and <em>RelatedObjects</em> is refined
      to be a list. The use of <em>IfcRelNests</em> is repurposed to
      be a nesting of an ordered collections of parts.
