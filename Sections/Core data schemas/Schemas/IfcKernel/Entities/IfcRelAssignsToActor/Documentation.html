<p>The objectified relationship <em>IfcRelAssignsToActor</em> handles the assignment of objects (subtypes of <em>IfcObject</em>) to an actor (subtypes of <em>IfcActor</em>).</p>

<p>The <em>IfcRelAssignsToActor</em> objectified relationship defines a relationship between an <em>IfcActor</em> and one or many objects. A particular role of the actor played in that relationship can be associated. If specified, it takes priority over the role that may be directly assigned to the person or organization.</p>
