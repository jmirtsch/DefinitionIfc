      An <em>IfcWorkPlan</em> represents work plans in a construction or a facilities management project.

    <p>
      A work plan contains a set of work schedules for different
      purposes (including construction and facilities
      management). Contained work schedules are defined through
      the <em>IfcRelAggregates</em> relationship. Through
      inheritance from <em>IfcWorkControl</em> it is also possible
      to define references to activities (for example, <em>IfcTask</em>)
      and resources used in the work plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      A work plan has information such as start date, finish
      date, total free float, and so on. <em>IfcWorkPlan</em> can
      also refer to the construction project represented by the
      single <em>IfcProject</em> instance (please also check the
      definition of <em>IfcWorkControl</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Figure 139 shows the backbone structure of a work plan that
      defines (1) contained work schedules through
      <em>IfcRelAggregates</em> and (2), if not assigned otherwise
      to contained work schedules, assigned tasks and resources
      through <em>IfcRelAssignsToControl</em>.
    </p>

<p>If an assigned <i>IfcTask</i> is a root-level task, such task must be declared on the <i>IfcProject</i> using the <i>IfcRelDeclares</i> relationship.</p>
