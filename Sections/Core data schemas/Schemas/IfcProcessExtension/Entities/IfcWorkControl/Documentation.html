      An <em>IfcWorkControl</em> is an abstract supertype which captures information that is common to both <em>IfcWorkPlan</em> and <em>IfcWorkSchedule</em>.

    <p>
      A work control may have resources assigned to it. This is
      handled by the <em>IfcRelAssignsToControl</em> relationship.
      A work control should also define a context that gives
      further information about its usage. If no special context
      information is required then the <em>IfcProject</em> instance
      as a global context should be used instead. An explicit
      link between the work control and the <em>IfcProject</em> via
      <em>IfcRelDeclares</em> should then be provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attribute <em>IfcWorkControl.Purpose</em> is used to
      define the purpose of either a work schedule or a work
      plan. In the case of <em>IfcWorkPlan</em>, the purpose
      attribute can be used to determine if the work plan is for
      cost estimating, task scheduling or some other defined
      purpose.
