      The <em>IfcProcessExtension</em> schema provides the primary
      information that expands one of the key ideas of the IFC
      Model. This is the idea of 'process' which captures ideas
      about the mapping of processes in a logical sequence or
      planning and scheduling of work and the tasks required for
      its completion. It is important to understand that process
      information can be expressed by classes in exactly the same
      way as product information.

      The <em>IfcProcessExtension</em> schema extends the primary
      idea of the <em>IfcProcess</em> outlined in the
      <em>IfcKernel</em> schema. The objective of the
      <em>IfcProcessExtension</em> schema is to capture information
      that supports the mapping of processes and the planning and
      scheduling of work and the procedures and resources
      required to carry out work. The aim is to provide support
      for information exchange and sharing within commonly used
      process mapping and scheduling applications; the extent of
      the model will not support the more detailed ideas found in
      more specialized applications.

      The following are within the scope of this part of the
      specifications:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>definition of work plans including the tasks that are
      included within the plan and identification of the
      resources required by the plan,
      </li>
      <li>definition of work schedules together with the elements
      that make up the schedule, the time constraints and
      durations applicable to the elements,
      </li>
      <li>identification of work tasks and task types included in
      plans and schedules,
      </li>
      <li>identification of procedures and procedure types that
      identify procedural steps required in response to an event,
      </li>
      <li>identification of events and event types that identify
      points in a process at which a particular response is
      required,
      </li>
      <li>identification of the relationship between a process
      and the resources that are consumed by the process,
      </li>
      <li>allocation of resources to work plans, work schedules
      and work tasks.
      </li>
    </ul>
