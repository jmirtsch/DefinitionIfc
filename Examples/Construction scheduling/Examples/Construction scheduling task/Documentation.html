<p>The focus point of this example is linking building elements to the task of a construction schedule to enable construction scheduling.</p>
<p>
The example includes a hierarchy of tasks assigned to  building elements. One task is assigned to pour a concrete
slab, and four tasks are assigned to construct respective walls. The tasks are sequenced, where the walls are
constructed in serial, following completion of the slab. The walls are nested into summary tasks for the slab and
walls.
</p>
<p>The slabs and walls in the example have a local placement, a body shape representation, and a material assignment.</p>
<p>Figure 477 shows a GANTT chart representing the tasks of the construction schedule.</p>

The project consists of a site aggregating a building which aggregates a building storey. The building storey contains
a slab and four walls, each physically connected using <i>IfcRelConnectsElements</i> where the <i>RelatingElement</i> anchors the <i>RelatedElement</i>. The slab and walls have standard shape that is expressed parametrically using <em>ifcMaterialLayerSetUsage</em> 
and <em>IfcExtrudedAreaSolid</em> geometry. Therefore the slab and the walls are expressed as <em>IfcSlabStandardCase</em> and <em>IfcWallStandardCase</em>. See Figure E26 for the geometric representation of the construction elements assigned to the tasks of the 
construction schedule.

Each task is assigned to a resulting product produced by the task using the <i>IfcRelAssignsToProduct</i>
relationship. The root task and the construction tasks form a hierachical task - subtask relationship provided
by <em>IfcRelNests</em>. The time related information (start time, end time) is added to each <em>IfcTask</em> by
<em>IfcTaskTime</em>. See Figure 479 for an instantiation diagram.
